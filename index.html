                    <h2>About Me</h2>
                    <p>
                        Transitioning from sustainable farming to programming, 
                        I bring a harmonious blend of creativity, innovation, 
                        and practicality to agritech solutions. 
                        My passion for technology is deeply rooted in a commitment
                        to addressing global challenges, such as climate change, 
                        resource scarcity, and agricultural inefficiencies. 
                        By combining my technical expertise in programming languages like HTML,
                        CSS, Python, and SQL with hands-on experience in sustainable farming, 
                        I aim to bridge the gap between traditional agriculture and cutting-edge technological advancements.
        
                        My journey is fueled by curiosity and a desire to revolutionize the future of smart farming. 
                        From integrating AI and IoT into crop management to designing closed-loop systems
                        that eliminate waste, I am driven by the potential to create impactful, scalable solutions. 
                        With a focus on sustainable practices and data-driven innovations, 
                        I am dedicated to helping farmers thrive in an increasingly digital world,
                        while preserving the environment for generations to come.

                    or personnel—to maximize productivity while minimizing waste. 
                    This involves identifying areas for improvement,
