                    <h2>About Me</h2>
                    <p>
                        Transitioning from sustainable farming to programming, 
                        I bring a harmonious blend of creativity, innovation, 
                        and practicality to agritech solutions. 
                        My passion for technology is deeply rooted in a commitment
                        to addressing global challenges, such as climate change, 
                        resource scarcity, and agricultural inefficiencies. 
                        By combining my technical expertise in programming languages like HTML,
                        CSS, Python, and SQL with hands-on experience in sustainable farming, 
                        I aim to bridge the gap between traditional agriculture and cutting-edge technological advancements.
                        <br>
                        My journey is fueled by curiosity and a desire to revolutionize the future of smart farming. 
                        From integrating AI and IoT into crop management to designing closed-loop systems
                        that eliminate waste, I am driven by the potential to create impactful, scalable solutions. 
                        With a focus on sustainable practices and data-driven innovations, 
                        I am dedicated to helping farmers thrive in an increasingly digital world,
                        while preserving the environment for generations to come.

                    Adaptability I excel in collaboration by actively engaging with team members,

                <br>
                    Problem-solving is at the core of my approach to challenges. 
                    I analyze situations critically, break complex problems into manageable steps, 
                    and develop effective solutions. My ability to remain calm under pressure and

                <li>Business: Strategy and Resource Management 
                    I excel in developing strategic plans that align with both 
                    short-term objectives and long-term visions. 
                    My approach involves analyzing data, identifying opportunities, 
                    and crafting innovative solutions to drive efficiency, growth, and sustainability. 
                    By prioritizing clear goals and actionable steps, 
                    I help streamline processes and optimize outcomes, 
                    whether in agritech projects or broader business ventures.
                <br>
                    Resource management is another cornerstone of my business expertise. 
                    I am adept at allocating resources—be it time, budget, 
                    or personnel—to maximize productivity while minimizing waste. 
                    This involves identifying areas for improvement, 
                    implementing tools to monitor resource usage, 
                    and ensuring alignment between resource availability and project demands. 
                    My ability to adapt and reallocate in dynamic environments ensures effective management, 
                    even under constraints, fostering resilience and success.</li>
